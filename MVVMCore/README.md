# MVVMCore for WPF Project

MVVMCore for WPF is a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) framework tailored specifically for WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) applications. MVVM is a design pattern that facilitates a clear separation of concerns in your application's architecture, making it easier to maintain and test.

## Key Features

1. **MVVM Architecture:** The project follows the MVVM architectural pattern, which separates the user interface (View), the presentation logic (ViewModel), and the data (Model). This separation enhances maintainability and testability of your WPF application.

2. **Core Functionality:** MVVMCore provides the core functionalities required for implementing the MVVM pattern in WPF applications, including data binding, commands, and ViewModel-View communication.

3. **ViewModelBase Class:** The project includes a base class for ViewModels (`ViewModelBase`), which implements common functionalities such as property notification (INotifyPropertyChanged) and command management, reducing boilerplate code in ViewModel implementations.

4. **Command Binding:** MVVMCore simplifies the implementation of commands in ViewModels, allowing easy binding of commands to user interface elements in XAML.

5. **Dependency Injection Support:** The framework supports dependency injection, enabling better decoupling and testability by allowing dependencies to be injected into ViewModels.

## How to Use

To integrate MVVMCore into your WPF project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Reference MVVMCore Library:** Add a reference to the MVVMCore library in your WPF project.

3. **Inherit from ViewModelBase:** Create ViewModels for your application by inheriting from the `ViewModelBase` class provided by MVVMCore.

4. **Implement Views:** Create Views using WPF XAML and bind them to the corresponding ViewModels.

5. **Run Your Application:** Build and run your WPF application to see MVVMCore in action!
